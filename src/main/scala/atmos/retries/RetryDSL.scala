/**
 * Defines a domain specific language for constructing and using retry policies.
 *
 * ==Getting Started==
 *
 * To use this DSL, start by adding the following imports to your Scala file:
 * {{{
 * import atmos.retries.RetryDSL._
 * import scala.concurrent.duration._ // Optional, only needed if you are defining durations.
 * }}}
 *
 * Next, define and configure an implicit retry policy:
 * {{{
 * implicit val retryPolicy = retryFor { 5.minutes } using linearBackoff { 2.seconds } monitorWith System.out onError {
 *   case _: IllegalArgumentException => stopRetrying
 * }
 * }}}
 * The above policy will retry for at most 5 minutes using a linearly-increasing backoff starting at 2 seconds, printing
 * all events to `System.out` and failing-fast if an `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown. See below for more examples
 * of retry policy declarations.
 *
 * Finally, add a call to `retry` or `retryAsync` around the target operation:
 * {{{
 * retry() { /* Some operation that might fail. */ }
 *
 * retryAsync() { Future { /* Some asynchronous operation that might fail. */ } }
 * }}}
 * Note: to use `retryAsync` you must also have an implicit instance of `scala.concurrent.ExecutionContext` in scope.
 *
 * ==Termination Policies==
 *
 * Termination policies determine when a retry operation will make no further attempts and are typically the first thing
 * defined for a retry policy. See [[atmos.retries.TerminationPolicy]] for more information.
 *
 * A retry policy with the default termination policy of limiting an operation to 3 attempts can be created with
 * `retrying`:
 * {{{
 * implicit val retryPolicy = retrying
 * }}}
 *
 * Additionally, custom termination policies can be specified using `retryFor`:
 * {{{
 * // Terminate after 5 failed attempts.
 * implicit val retryPolicy = retryFor { 5.attempts }
 *
 * // Terminate after retrying for at least 5 minutes.
 * implicit val retryPolicy = retryFor { 5.minutes }
 *
 * // Terminate after 5 failed attempts or retrying for at least 5 minutes, whichever comes first.
 * implicit val retryPolicy = retryFor { 5.attempts || 5.minutes }
 *
 * // Terminate after at least 5 failed attempts but not before retrying for at least 5 minutes.
 * implicit val retryPolicy = retryFor { 5.attempts && 5.minutes }
 * }}}
 * Note that the `5.minutes` parameter is an instance of `scala.concurrent.duration.FiniteDuration` and that any
 * instance of this class may be used as a policy in `retryFor`.
 *
 * Finally, a retry policy that immediately terminates can be created with `neverRetry` and a retry policy that never
 * terminates (unless directed to by an error classifier) can be created with `retryForever`:
 * {{{
 * implicit val retryPolicy = neverRetry
 * 
 * implicit val retryPolicy = retryForever
 * }}}
 *
 * ==Backoff Policies==
 *
 * Backoff policies specify the delay between subsequent retry attempts and are configured on a retry policy with
 * `using`. See [[atmos.retries.BackoffPolicy]] for more information.
 *
 * This DSL provides support for the four provided backoff policies (or any custom policy):
 * {{{
 * implicit val retryPolicy = retryForever using constantBackoff { 5.millis }
 *
 * implicit val retryPolicy = retryForever using linearBackoff { 5.seconds }
 *
 * implicit val retryPolicy = retryForever using exponentialBackoff { 5.minutes }
 *
 * // Uses the default backoff duration (100 milliseconds) when the parameter is omitted.
 * implicit val retryPolicy = retryForever using fibonacciBackoff()
 * }}}
 *
 * ==Monitor Configuration==
 *
 * Event monitors are notified when retry attempts fail and are configured on a retry policy using `monitorWith`. See
 * [[atmos.retries.EventMonitor]] for more information.
 *
 * This DSL provides support for monitoring retry attempts with print streams and loggers (or any custom monitor):
 * {{{
 * // Write information about failed attempts to stderr.
 * implicit val retryPolicy = retryForever monitorWith System.err
 *
 * // Write information about failed attempts to the specified instance of java.util.logging.Logger.
 * implicit val retryPolicy = retryForever monitorWith Logger.getLogger("MyLoggerName")
 * }}}
 *
 * ==Error Classification==
 *
 * Errors that occur during a retry attempt can be classified as `Fatal`, `Recoverable` or `SilentlyRecoverable`.
 * Retry policies can be configured with error classification functions using `onError`. See
 * [[atmos.retries.ErrorClassification]] for more information.
 *
 * This DSL provides support for the three provided error classifications:
 * {{{
 * // Stop retrying after any runtime exception.
 * implicit val retryPolicy = retryForever onError { case _: RuntimeException => stopRetrying }
 *
 * // Continue retrying after an illegal argument exception and retrying silently after an illegal state exception.
 * implicit val retryPolicy = retryForever onError {
 *   case _: IllegalArgumentException => keepRetrying
 *   case _: IllegalStateException => keepRetryingSilently
 * }
 * }}}
